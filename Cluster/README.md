# Cluster Configurations

This directory contains example configurations for different
Kubernetes backends (k3s, kind, k3d, etc.) that can be used
to run the experiments in this repository.

Each subdirectory documents its own setup and any caveats.

- `k3s/`  - configs / notes for k3s-based clusters
- `kind/` - configs for kind
- `k3d/`  - configs for k3d

Experiments should document which backend(s) they have been
tested against.
